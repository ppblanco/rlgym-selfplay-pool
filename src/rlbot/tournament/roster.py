"""Tournament roster: which bot belongs to whom, where its checkpoint lives, and
its architecture/obs dimension (auto-detected from the saved weights).

Design notes
------------
- A "checkpoint" is an rlgym-ppo folder containing PPO_POLICY.pt +
  BOOK_KEEPING_VARS.json (the numeric <timestep> directory). ROSTER_CONFIG may
  point at that folder directly OR at any ancestor -- resolve_checkpoint() picks
  the latest (highest-timestep) checkpoint beneath it.
- obs_dim is read straight from the policy's first-layer weight shape: 89 ==
  DefaultObs, 107 == AdvancedObs. This is what lets cross-architecture matches
  work (see rlbot.tournament.obs.make_env).
- Owners whose checkpoint is missing/empty (e.g. a teammate who hasn't pushed
  yet) are SKIPPED with a warning rather than crashing the whole tournament.
  Run `python -m rlbot.tournament.download` to fetch them first.

This module is import-light on purpose: torch is imported lazily inside
detect_arch() so the pure bracket/test code never pays for it.
